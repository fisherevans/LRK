## Intro

LRK is a 2D, top-down RPG written in Java. The game uses the JBox2D, Slick2D, LWJGL, and JXInput libraries. This game is a prequel to my other project The Wayward Crown (TWC). It focuses on collecting relics around the ruins of the lost land of Kazar in an attempt bring the old empire back to power.

## Basic Game Layout

When making a profile, users must choose between playing as a Mage or a Warrior. (Other classes may be added later). As you travel from dungeon to dungeon, you'll encounter many enemies that you'll have to defeat to reach the relic at the end. As you progress, you can obtain new, more powerful weapons, armor and consumables aiding in your quest.

Players have three skill type: Health, Power and Defence. As a player levels up they will be able to put a certain amount of skill points towards any of their skills. The biggest part of character progression is the loot they receive from enemies and chests that they encounter.

## Loot

Loot is dropped from slain enemies or opened chests. Players will not receive loot that does not help their character. If a creature would drop an item that is strictly worse than their current item, the player will never see it. A player will also never get drops for a class that they are not. There is no money and players must drop items to clean their inventory.

### Equipment

Each player had 5 slots for equipment: Head, Chest, Legs, Main Hand and Off Hand. Each can increase there defence and power in addition to being enchanted. Enchantments greatly improve the quality of the item by adding addition damage, armor, attack speed or health bonuses.

### Consumables

The other kind of loot is consumables. These include things like health potions, damage type modifiers, temporary stat boosts, etc. Consumables to either be used from the inventory, or can be added to the player hot bar (1-4 keys) allowing them to activate a consumable during combat.
